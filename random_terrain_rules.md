### Random Terrain Effects

When rolling on the left column of the random terrain table, you'll notice a number. This number is then used to scale the effects from the right column of the random terrain table, and it replaces X.

Element|Effect
-|-
**Bridge**|Models can only move one at a time, creating a "choke point". In close combat on the bridge. Model that ends its charge in 2" of this terrain gets +1 to their WS due to restricted movement.
**Tower**|Models on the tower (on whatever can be considered its top floor or its roof) grant their warband vision of all hidden enemy models.
**Heap**|Counts as very difficult terrain (1/4 of the movement).
**Wall**|Models in 2" of the wall can attempt to read whatever scribbled on them by rolling 1d6. On 1-3 they accidently curse themselves, and need to test their Leadership and be out of action on fail. On 4-5 they learn about small hidden stash: your warband will get 1d6 gold if this model survives this game. On 6 they learn about big stash: your warband will get 3d6 and a sword if this model survives this game. 4-6 effects can only be triggered once per warband playing this game.
**Entrance to**|If a model ends its movement phase in 2" of entrance, it can attempt to enter the terrain by rolling 1D6. On a 4+, they can exit anywhere within 2" of entrance (models that are in base to base contact with an enemy model as a result of this counts as charged).
**Pit with**|Any model within 2" of the pit must roll test their initiative at the recovery phase. On fail, they fall into the pit and are out of the game.

Element|Effect
-|-
**Poisoned river**| During their recovery phase, any model in the river must pass a toughness test. If failed, they are poisoned: when rolling for serious injuries at the end of the game, they suffer -X to the result.
**Raven's nest**|Models within X" of the nest must pass a leadership test in their recovery phase. If failed, they attempt to flee the battlefield.
**Ruined statue**|If your model ends its movement within 2" of this terrain, roll 1D6. On a 4+, the model finds a hidden treasure! It adds +X (to a max of 6) to a single exploration dice roll after the game.
**Shattered tower**|Any models ending their movement phase within 2" of the tower must pass an initiative test. If failed, they trigger a trap and suffer 1D3 SX hits from falling debris.
**Tombs**|At the beginning of the game, after model setup, roll 1D6. On a 1-3, the tombs emit a foul stench: any model ending its turn within X" of the tombs is automatically out of action as soon as their wound counter drops to 0 or lower. On a 4-5, the tombs emit dying gasps: any hit rolls (WS or BS) within X" of the tombs suffer a -1 modifier. On a 6, the first model to enter within 2" of the tombs finds a golden tooth in one of the deceased's mouths, worth X gold coins.
**Eerie glow**|If any model of winning warband is standing in 2" of this terrain at the end of a game, then roll 1d6. On 1 the glow turns out to be nothing. On 2-5 it was gold glowing! Warband gets Xd6 gold coins. On 6 It was gold and wyrdstone glowing! Warband gets Xd6 gold and X wyrdstone!
