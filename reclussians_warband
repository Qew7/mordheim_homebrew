Warband Rules for Stormcast Eternals Reclusians
===============================================

### **General Rules**
- **Development Dice Limit:** Reclusians warbands are limited to **5 Development Dice** during their post-battle sequence.
- **Memorians as Henchmen:** Memorians are hired using a unique **2d6 Hiring Table** (detailed below). Each roll incurs a hiring cost, regardless of whether you successfully find a Memorian.

---

### **Memorian Hiring Table**
Roll **2d6** to determine the Memorian you find (if any).  
**Cost to Roll:** 10 Gold Crowns per attempt (regardless of success).  
Memorians grant bonuses only if they are within **6 inches** of their paired Stormcast model.

| Roll | Result                                          | Notes                                             |
|------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | No Memorian Found                              | You fail to locate any Memorians this round.     |
| 3-4  | Memorian: +1 Weapon Skill (WS)                | Grants +1 WS to the paired Stormcast.            |
| 5-6  | Memorian: +1 Initiative (I)                   | Grants +1 Initiative to the paired Stormcast.    |
| 7    | Memorian: No Effect                           | You find a Memorian, but it grants no bonus.     |
| 8-9  | Memorian: +1 Leadership (Ld)                  | Grants +1 Leadership to the paired Stormcast.    |
| 10-11| Memorian: +1 Strength (S)                     | Grants +1 Strength to the paired Stormcast.      |
| 12   | Memorian: +1 Toughness (T)                    | Grants +1 Toughness to the paired Stormcast.     |

*Note:* Memorian bonuses only apply while the Stormcast and Memorian remain within **6 inches** of each other.

---

### **Reclusian Skills Table**
Reclusians may choose skills from the following unique table during advancement:

1. **Lightning Descent**  
   During deployment, the Reclusian may choose to hold one Stormcast model in reserve. Deploy that model during any Movement Phase. Upon arrival, all enemy models within **3 inches** take a **Strength 3 hit**.  

2. **Aetheric Shield**  
   The Stormcast gains a **5+ save against magic attacks**. If already wearing Stormcast armor, this improves to a **4+ save**.

3. **Celestial Charge**  
   Once per battle, the Stormcast can make a **d6-inch charge move** without needing line of sight. This charge ignores difficult terrain penalties.

4. **Storm-Forged Will**  
   The Reclusian gains immunity to **fear and panic**. Additionally, once per battle, they can automatically pass a Leadership test.

5. **Sigmar’s Fury**  
   Once per game, the Reclusian can channel divine energy to reroll **all failed rolls to wound** in a single combat phase.

---

### **Weapon & Armor Upgrade System**
Stormcast warriors can upgrade standard Mordheim equipment with unique Stormcast enhancements. These upgrades are specific, flavorful, and affordable.

#### **Weapon Upgrades**
1. **Sigmarite Edge:** Weapons gain a critical hit bonus against Chaos-aligned models, critting on **5-6** instead of 6. (**Cost:** 15 Gold Crowns)
2. **Runed Strikes:** Reroll failed **to-hit rolls** against Daemons. (**Cost:** 10 Gold Crowns)
3. **Thundering Blows:** Melee attacks gain **+1 Strength** on the charge. (**Cost:** 15 Gold Crowns)

#### **Armor Upgrades**
1. **Celestial Plate:** Standard armor improves by **+1 save** (e.g., light armor becomes 5+, heavy armor becomes 4+). (**Cost:** 20 Gold Crowns)
2. **Aetheric Sigil:** Grants a **6+ Ward Save**. (**Cost:** 10 Gold Crowns)
3. **Lightning Resilience:** The Stormcast becomes immune to **Stun effects**, treating them as Knocked Down instead. (**Cost:** 15 Gold Crowns)

Generating lore for the Stormcast Reclusians warband...

---

### **Stormcast Reclusians: Heralds of the Fractured Aether**  
Among the shadowed alleys and crumbling ruins of Mordheim, tales have begun to spread of armored giants striding through the Wyrdstone-strewn streets. These enigmatic warriors call themselves *Reclusians of the Fractured Aether*. To some, they are divine emissaries sent by Sigmar himself, celestial knights plucked from the heavens to purge the corruption of Chaos from this cursed city. To others, they are deluded zealots, twisted souls clad in scavenged armor, their minds broken by the impossible horrors that Mordheim has to offer.  

Their leader, known only as the **Stormcall Reclusian**, preaches of a shattered gateway between realms—a rent in the "Aetheric Veil" through which they descended. Their arrival was heralded, they claim, by visions of Sigmar’s lightning-scorched throne and whispers of divine purpose. Yet no two warriors seem to remember the same journey, and their fragmented recollections only deepen the mystery surrounding their origins.

---

### **The Memorians: Echoes or Madness?**  
The Reclusians do not walk alone. Shadowing them are the Memorians, hooded figures who seem eerily devoted to their paired warriors. These Memorians speak in riddles, their mutterings invoking fragments of an otherworldly tongue. They claim to act as "Anchors," ensuring the Stormcast retain their divine clarity amidst the Wyrdstone’s maddening influence.  

However, there are darker rumors among those who have survived encounters with these warriors. Some insist the Memorians are the true masters of the warband, manipulating their so-called champions for some unknowable purpose. Others suggest they are hallucinations, figments of the Stormcast’s cracked minds, or worse—manifestations of the Wyrdstone’s influence taking root.  

Strangest of all, when a Memorian dies, their Stormcast companion often flies into a murderous rage, screaming not prayers to Sigmar but garbled nonsense, as if the death has severed some vital tether.

---

### **Clues to Their Origins**  
Hints of their true nature lie scattered among their actions and words, though none provide a definitive answer:  
- **Divine Beings?** Their armor is unlike anything seen in Mordheim, gleaming with celestial brilliance even after wading through the filth of the ruins. Their weapons strike with the fury of a storm, and their presence inspires awe or dread in all who witness them.  
- **Madmen in Disguise?** Their "divine lightning" sometimes fizzles like alchemical tricks, and more than one blacksmith swears their "Sigmarite plate" looks suspiciously like repurposed Empire steel.  
- **Isekai’d Warriors?** The Reclusians speak of places that do not exist on any map—Azyrheim, Ghyran, the Allpoints—and their prayers often reference a pantheon unfamiliar to even the most learned scholars of Sigmarite faith.  

It is said that on rare occasions, the Reclusians mutter of a *return to the storm*. What they mean by this, none can say. Do they seek to escape Mordheim and return to their celestial homeland, or is it merely the fevered rambling of the mad?

---

### **The Grim and the Humorous**  
The warband’s behavior walks a razor’s edge between solemnity and absurdity, their zeal occasionally veering into the bizarre. Some examples include:  
- The Stormcall Reclusian once declared an abandoned cabbage cart to be "a sigil of Sigmar's will" and led the warband in a day-long ritual to "purify" it.  
- Memorians sometimes forget their "divine purpose" and wander off mid-battle, leaving their Stormcast companion to shout incoherent prayers until they reappear.  
- When asked how they arrived in Mordheim, one warrior replied cryptically, "I was pulled through the sky on a chariot of golden lightning," while another simply muttered, "I tripped."

Despite their peculiarities, the Reclusians fight with a ferocity that cannot be denied. Whether they are divine emissaries, lunatics, or something else entirely, one thing is certain: they are a force to be reckoned with, and Mordheim trembles beneath their storm-forged boots.

This lore provides ambiguity, depth, and just enough dark humor to match the grimdark tone of Mordheim. Let me know if you'd like further tweaks!

Generating Reclusians’ Serious Injury Table...

---

### **Reclusian Serious Injury Table: The Trial of Reforging**  
When a Reclusian suffers a serious injury or loses their Memorian, roll **2d6** on the table below. Each result represents a fragment of the reforging process—a violent, imperfect reconstruction of their soul that can grant blessings, curses, or both.  

The changes to a Reclusian are permanent, reflecting their gradual transformation into something increasingly alien to mortal comprehension.

---

| Roll | Result                                                                                         | Effect                                                                                          |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | **The Shattered Soul**                                                                        | The Stormcast’s mind is fractured. The model suffers -1 Leadership (**Ld**) permanently.        |
| 3    | **Lightning-Wreathed Fury**                                                                   | Lightning surges uncontrollably through their body. At the start of each battle, roll a D6: on a 1, the model takes a Strength 3 hit. |
| 4    | **Sigmar’s Wrath Burns Within**                                                               | Their soul becomes volatile. The model gains +1 Strength (**S**) but suffers -1 Initiative (**I**). |
| 5    | **Echoes of the Aether**                                                                      | Their voice becomes distorted and otherworldly. Enemies in combat with this model suffer -1 Leadership (**Ld**) when testing Fear. |
| 6    | **Battle-Scarred Veteran**                                                                    | The reforging strengthens their resolve. The model becomes immune to Panic but cannot run in battle. |
| 7    | **Soul Fragmentation**                                                                        | The process has left the soul weakened but strangely resilient. The model suffers -1 Wound (**W**) permanently but gains a **6+ Ward Save**. |
| 8    | **Eyes of the Storm**                                                                         | Lightning crackles from their eyes, illuminating the darkness. The model can reroll failed Initiative (**I**) tests in the dark but suffers -1 Weapon Skill (**WS**) due to disorientation. |
| 9    | **Celestial Strength**                                                                        | Their reforged body carries fragments of Sigmar’s divine power. Gain +1 Toughness (**T**) but suffer -1 Initiative (**I**) as their movements slow. |
| 10   | **The Scars of Rebirth**                                                                      | The model’s reforged flesh is covered in glowing, storm-like scars. Gain **+1 Armor Save**, but enemy models gain +1 to hit them in combat due to their luminescent aura. |
| 11   | **The Call of the Aetheric Veil**                                                             | The reforging has left the Stormcast attuned to the divine, but distant from reality. The model gains +1 to all spell resistance rolls but suffers -1 Leadership (**Ld**) permanently. |
| 12   | **Sigmar’s Chosen**                                                                           | The reforging is near-perfect. The model gains **+1 Weapon Skill (WS)** and immunity to Stun results, but their presence unnerves allies, who suffer -1 Leadership when within 6 inches. |

### **Special Rule: Memorian Death Effects**
When a Memorian dies, the connected Stormcast must immediately roll on the **Trial of Reforging** table. This represents the spiritual and emotional shattering caused by the loss of their "Anchor."  
- If the Stormcast already rolled a result due to an injury earlier in the same battle, reroll duplicate results until a new trial effect is applied.  
- The reforging effects stack, representing the gradual transformation of the warrior’s soul into something increasingly alien.

---

### **Design Philosophy**  
The Reclusians’ "Trial of Reforging" table emphasizes the duality of the reforging process. Each result reflects the flawed nature of Sigmar's gift: it strengthens his champions but at a terrible cost. This ensures a balance between power and sacrifice, keeping the warband’s gameplay in line with its grim lore.
