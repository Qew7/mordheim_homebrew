# Warband Rules for Stormcast Eternals Ruination Chamber
===============================================

### **Special Rules**
- **Oathbound Discovery:** In post-battle sequence, in exploration phase, you do not gain any exploration dice for any Ruination Chamber heroes; instead, you roll one exploration dice per friendly memorian not taken out of action.
- **Memorians as Henchmen:** Memorians are hired using a **Memorian Hiring Table** (detailed below) instead of normal procedure of hiring henchmen in Mordheim rules (at start or in post-battle sequence). Each roll incurs a hiring cost, regardless of whether you successfully find a Memorian. If memorian is taken Out Of Action, invoke **Memorian Death Effects** rule after game.
- **Eternal Serving:** Ruination Chamber heroes can't be fired from a warband. Memorians cant'be promoted to be a hero through Lad's got a talent or any other mean.
- **The Trial of Reforging:** When a Ruination Chamber Hero is taken out of action during a game (or loses their Memorian) and rolls 12-16 results Serious Injury Table, roll **2d6** on the The **Trial of Reforging** table below, if he rolls 11 then roll on that table 3 times. Each result represents a fragment of the reforging process—a violent, imperfect reconstruction of their soul that can grant blessings, curses, or both.
- **Burn the Heretic!:** Witch Hunters harbor a deep-seated hatred for the Ruination Chamber, whom they consider heretics. As a result, any Witch hunter models with 'Burn the Witch' also hate members of the Ruination Chamber warband.

### **Memorian Hiring Table**
Before hiring you should choose Ruination Chamber hero you will pair your memorian with, only one memorian can be paired to a Ruination Chamber hero at a time.
**Cost to Buy:** 25 Gold Crowns per attempt (regardless of success).
Before rolling at Memorian Hiring table you should roll for rarity same way you roll for rarity of an item you wish to buy, consider **rarity** of a memorian as **8**.
Roll **2d6** to determine the Memorian you find (if any).  


At the start of each turn memorians grant bonuses only if they are within **6 inches** of their paired Ruination Chamber hero model, untill the start of next turn, or until Ruination chamber hero or memorian is forced to move (eg from falling) farther than **6 inches** away from its paired model on any enemy turn.
All Memorians give +1M as additional bonus to their paired Ruination Chamber hero.

| 2d6 | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2-4  | Found Memorian with Ancestor’s Blade Charm | Grants +1 WS to the paired Ruination Chamber hero |
| 5-6  | Found Memorian with Beacon Amulet | Grants +1 Leadership to the paired Ruination Chamber hero |
| 7-8  | Found Memorian with Faded Keepsake | You find a Memorian, but it grants no bonus |
| 9-10  | Found Memorian with Relic of the Windcaller | Grants +1 Initiative to the paired Ruination Chamber hero |
| 11 | Found Memorian with Hammerstone Pendant | Grants +1 Strength to the paired Ruination Chamber hero |
| 12   | Found Memorian with Aegis of the Stalwart | Grants +1 Toughness to the paired Ruination Chamber hero |

---

### **Memorian Death Effects**
When a Memorian is taken out of action, the paired Ruination Chamber hero must roll on the **Trial of Reforging** table after game even if  his the model didnt get taken Out Of Action, if it got taken Out Of Action and his memorian got taken Out Of Action then that model should roll on the **Trials of Reforging** twice. This represents the spiritual and emotional shattering caused by the loss of their "Anchor."
- The reforging effects do stack, but you can get maximum 5 **Trials of Reforging** effects.
- If the model already has 5 effects, then instead of rolling on **Trial of Reforging** table it loses 1 Movement (**M**) permanently.

### **The Trial of Reforging**

The changes to a Ruination Chamber heroes are permanent, reflecting their gradual transformation into something increasingly alien to mortal comprehension.

| 2d6 | Result | Effect |
|-|-|-|
| 2 | **The Shattered Soul**  | The Stormcast’s body is fractured. The model suffers -1 Toughness (**T**) permanently. |
| 3 | **Lightning-Wreathed Fury** | Lightning surges uncontrollably through their body. At the start of each battle, roll a D6: on a 1, the model takes a Strength 3 hit, no armor saves apply. |
| 4 | **Sigmar’s Wrath Burns Within** | Their soul becomes volatile. The model forgets one random skill they learned. |
| 5 | **Echoes of the Aether**  | Their voice becomes distorted and otherworldly. Enemies in combat with this model suffer -1 Leadership (**Ld**) when testing Fear. |
| 6 | **Battle-Scarred Veteran** | The reforging strengthens their resolve. The model becomes immune to Fear but cannot run. |
| 7 | **Soul Fragmentation** | The process has left the soul weakened but strangely resilient. The model suffers -1 Wound (**W**) (down to at least 1) permanently but gains a **+1 Armor Save** against ranged attacks. |
| 8 | **Eyes of the Storm** | Lightning crackles from their eyes, illuminating the darkness. The model can add 4 to their Initiative (**I**) to the distance from which he is able to spot hidden enemies, as if they carried a lantern but permanently suffers -1 Weapon Skill (**WS**) due to disorientation. |
| 9 | **Celestial Strength** | Their reforged body carries fragments of Sigmar’s divine power. Gain +1 Wound (**W**) but suffer -1 Initiative (**I**) as their reaction become slower. |
| 10 | **The Scars of Rebirth** | The model’s reforged flesh is covered in glowing, storm-like scars. Enemy models gain -1 to **to-hit rolls** in both melee and ranged combat against them due to their luminescent aura. |
| 11 | **The Call of the Aetheric Veil**  | The reforging has left the Stormcast attuned to the divine, but distant from reality. The model gains 6+ save from spells but suffers -1 Leadership (**Ld**) permanently. |
| 12 | **Sigmar’s Chosen** | The reforging is near-perfect. The model gains **+1 Weapon Skill (WS)**. |

---

### **Ruination Chamber Skills Table**
Ruination Chamber heroes may choose skills from the following table during advancement:

1. **Lightning Descent**  
   During deployment, this model may choose to be held in reserve. Deploy that model during any of yours Recovery Phases. Find the memorian paired with the descending model, and pick any point on the board within 6" of them without any roof on top of it, then test initiative (**I**): upon succesful test that model arrived on that point, upon failure use scatter dice and d6 to locate its arrival point relative to selected point. Upon arrival, all models within **3 inches** take a **one 1d3+1 Strength hit** with armor saves applied as normal. If reserved model has no paired memorian on the table, then it is considered taken out of action. 

2. **Celestial Charge**  
   Once per battle, in charge phase, the Stormcast can make a charge without needing line of sight. This charge ignores difficult terrain penalties.

3. **Storm-Forged Will**  
   This model automatically passes **all-alone** tests.

4. **Sigmar’s Fury**  
   Once per game, this model can channel divine energy to reroll **one failed roll to wound** in first combat phase.

# Lore

### The Refugee’s Tale

You’ve heard of Mordheim, right? Of course you have. Everyone has. A place where life and death play their wicked games—where the only thing that ever survives is the hunger of the Wyrdstone. But not all of us go there to seek riches. Some of us go to forget. Or to hide. And some of us... well, we end up caught in something much worse.  

I don’t know what brought you to here, stranger, but I can guess why you’re leaving. The stones here whisper madness, and the air tastes of despair. You’ve heard the same tales as I have—the Wyrdstone, the riches. Lies to draw fools in. There’s nothing here but death.  

Still, you’ve been lucky, or clever, or both. Not everyone is. Did I ever tell you about the shining giants? No? Then sit, and listen.

I’ve been hiding, you see. Hiding for years, since the fall of the city. No one looks for me, I thought. A mere refugee, one of many whose stories are lost in the ashes. But I’ve learned something strange.

It was the second moon of my exile. I’d found shelter in a crumbling ruin—half a church, half a tomb. The walls still stood, for the most part, and there was a staircase leading to a cellar. The kind of place where one might sleep without fear of claw or dagger in the night. Or so I thought.  

I heard the battle before I saw it: steel ringing against steel, shouts like thunderclaps, and the crunch of stone breaking under monstrous strength. I crept to a crack in the wall, and there they were.  

They stood taller than any man, clad in armor that gleamed . Gold, or something that pretended to be gold. Their faces... I can’t say I saw them, not really. Their helms covered all but their eyes—or what should have been eyes. One or two of them had that otherworldly glow, and it flickered like dying embers. The others... their eyes were ordinary, yet unsettling. The way they stared—fixed and unblinking—made you wonder if there was anything human left behind those visors.

Their armor gleamed like the last light of a dying sun. The light didn’t reflect off them the way it should have. It didn’t glimmer, it *shone*. No, not even that—more like it absorbed the world around it, swallowed the darkness. Gold, or something that pretended to be gold. Their faces... I can’t say I saw them, not really. Their helms covered all but their eyes—or what should have been eyes. One or two of them had that otherworldly glow, and it flickered like dying embers. The others... their eyes were ordinary, yet unsettling. The way they stared—fixed and unblinking—made you wonder if there was anything human left behind those visors. They stood like pillars of stone, silent, unmovable, and yet, I could hear the weight of their presence pressing down on everything. I could feel their *will*, like an invisible force, pushing against me.  

At first, I thought they might be saviors. Their swords flashed in perfect arcs, and the foes they struck fell like wheat to the scythe. But then I noticed their victims weren’t just beasts or mutants. No, there were men among them. Ragged, desperate men like me. Men whose only crime was surviving in this cursed place.  

One of the giants grabbed a man by the throat. Lifted him like he was nothing. The poor fool screamed, begged for mercy. The giant paused, tilted its head as if considering the plea... and then crushed his neck with a single hand. I still hear the crack in my nightmares.  

And their voices! Oh, their voices. Like the tolling of iron bells, deep and cold. They chanted something—prayers, maybe, or judgments. I couldn’t make out the words, but I could feel them, hammering against my mind like the blows of their warhammers.  

The few who escaped fled into the shadows, vanishing like smoke. The giants didn’t pursue. They simply stood there for a moment, as if listening to something I couldn’t hear. Then they turned and walked away, their footsteps shaking the ground.

One of them, however, lingered. He turned his head toward me. His face was hidden behind the shadow of his helm, but his eyes—ordinary, gray as storm clouds—met mine. There was nothing burning there, no fire or glow, yet something about them froze me in place. They were too still, too sharp. Eyes like that didn’t belong to a man who walked in peace with his own mind. They held a weight, a tension, as if teetering on the edge of some unknowable madness. I don’t really think it saw me, not really, but it *felt* me.

I thought he might approach, but he didn’t. He lingered only a moment longer before turning and following the others into the ruins.

It was only later, when I gathered the courage to return to the temple, that I realized something strange. My amulet—a small, worn trinket I’d carried since before I could remember—was glowing faintly in the dim light. It had always been with me, a simple charm that I’d thought nothing of. But now, when I held it, my mind was flooded with images. Flashing memories. A life not my own. A life filled with pain—and purpose.

I thought I was safe for a while. I thought I could escape, blend into the ruins like so many others, fade into the dust of Mordheim. But that amulet - they *feel* it.  

It pulls me, and every time I try to leave, I hear them behind me, growing louder, closer. They’re coming. They’re always coming.  

I tried to leave the city. I thought, maybe, if I could get far enough away, they would forget. But no. The farther I went, the stronger the pull became. And then... then I heard it. Their war chant. A low, rhythmic chanting that sent shivers down my spine. I wasn’t sure if I was hearing it in the air or inside my mind. I could feel it, in my bones, in my very soul.  

And I knew then.  

They were *my* people. They had come for me. They had come for their *memorial*.  

I don’t understand what happened to me. I don’t know if I was a soldier once, or if they made me one. I don’t know if I died in that cursed city and they pulled me from the grave to serve them. But the more I think about it, the more I realize—it doesn’t matter.  

They are *coming*. I can feel it in my blood, in my flesh. Their eyes are on me, and they won’t stop until they’ve found me. Whether I’m some lost warrior, some remnant of a past life, or just another broken man is irrelevant. What matters is that I *belong* to them now. I’ve been marked. I’ve been chosen.  

So, you ask me what they were? Saints sent to cleanse Mordheim’s wickedness? Zealots drunk on their own madness? I don’t know. But I know they are *looking* for me. And they won’t stop until they find me.  

If you see their light in the dark, don’t run. Don’t pray. Don’t even breathe. Just hide. And hope their gods aren’t watching.

You might think I’m crazy. You might think it’s the madness of Mordheim that’s taken me, but I swear to you, I’m not lying. I’ve been hunted by something that is *not* of this world. Something that’s part of me and yet... not.

So, listen, my friend. The next time you see one of them—tall, armored, with eyes that burn like the sky just before a storm—run. Run, and don’t look back. Because if they find me, they’ll find you, too.  

And if they don’t... well, you’ll never know what might have been.  

But I won’t be here to tell you again.

We’re all just ghosts, walking through the ruins of a world that no longer remembers us. But they? They are *real*. And they will not stop until they have what they’re looking for.

### The Cultist's tale

We were never meant to win. I think we all knew that, deep down. We—the cult, the devoted, the possessed—rallied for what we thought would be a grand slaughter, a show of strength to prove ourselves worthy to our dark gods. We had the numbers, the ferocity, and the favor of the powers that lurk in the unseen. We were ready for anything.

Or so I thought.

It happened when we were gathered in the ruins, deep in Mordheim’s crumbling heart. The city, twisted as it is, had a way of making men feel invincible. It whispered promises of power and glory. It promised us that victory would be ours. Our leader—an old, half-mad sorcerer—had sensed a great power coming, something... different. We didn’t question it. When the dark god commands, we obey.

We were ready for a fight, but not that fight.

I saw them first—their shape, a silhouette in the mist of the early morning. At first, I thought they were just more scavengers, perhaps some desperate warband eking out an existence like us. But as they drew closer, it became clear: these were not ordinary men.

Their armor was wrong—pieces mismatched, jagged, as if torn from corpses and hammered into place with no care for fit or form. Rusted pauldrons jutted out unevenly, some patched with scavenged scraps of leather or chainmail. Their masks, if you could call them that, were crude things: misshapen, dented, some bearing the faint outlines of faces that had long since rusted away. One looked like a child’s doll mask, split in half and nailed onto a helmet. Another had holes so poorly placed it was a wonder the wearer could see at all.

But it was their movements that struck me the most. They didn’t march in unison like soldiers; they staggered, swayed, and lunged forward, each step filled with a manic energy that seemed to defy reason. Some swung their weapons idly, as if hearing music only they could perceive. Others clutched at their masks or pounded their fists against their armor, muttering words too garbled to understand.

Behind them came their squires—or monks, maybe. They moved more deliberately, their robes tattered but oddly pristine in places, as if carefully mended again and again. They carried no weapons, only strange tools: an empty lantern here, a rusted censer there, both swaying with every step. Their eyes stayed fixed on the ground as if unwilling—or unable—to look at the chaos ahead.

We charged, of course. The cult—madmen, possessed by all manner of demons—rushed forward with bloodlust in our veins. We screamed in defiance, in the name of our gods. We had the numbers. We had the fury. We would crush them.

But when we met them, it was like crashing into a storm of knives. Their weapons, mismatched and jagged like their armor, tore through our ranks with reckless abandon. One carried a cleaver so oversized it should have been unwieldy, yet he swung it with an unnatural grace. Another wielded a hammer that looked as if it had been forged from a broken anvil, its head covered in cracks that somehow didn’t weaken its devastating blows.

I saw one of our possessed—a hulking brute covered in chitinous growths—charge at a giant clad in a breastplate that looked as though it had been pried off a coffin. The giant didn’t even flinch. He howled—a raw, guttural sound that echoed like a thousand voices screaming in unison—and swung his weapon. The possessed fell, his body splitting apart like a ripe fruit.

For every blow we struck, they answered with five of their own. Yet their ferocity was chaotic, unhinged. I watched as one giant turned on another, swinging his axe wildly before seeming to regain focus and charge back into the fray. They fought like men who had lost their minds—or perhaps found something far worse.

And then one of them saw me.

His mask was a grotesque patchwork, half-covered in blood and grime. Through the slits, I saw eyes—not burning, not otherworldly, but unmistakably human. Yet there was nothing sane in that gaze. It darted back and forth, pupils dilated as though he were searching for something that wasn’t there. For a moment, I thought he might collapse under the weight of his own madness. Instead, he raised his blade, a crude thing pitted with rust, and came for me.

I couldn’t move. My legs felt like lead, my lungs like stone. But just as he reached me, he faltered. His head snapped to the side, as if hearing something only he could perceive. A low, guttural cry escaped his throat, and his knees buckled.

I saw then what I hadn’t noticed before: one of their monk-squires lay crumpled nearby, a claw from one of our possessed still buried deep in his chest. The giant’s hand reached toward the monk, trembling, as though to touch him. But before he could, his strength failed, and he slumped to the ground.

I didn’t wait to see what happened next. I ran. I ran faster than I ever thought possible, through the ruins and alleys, the screams of the battle fading behind me.

I don’t know how I escaped. I only know that I’m the last one left.

So I’m telling you this, brothers. You’ll think I’m mad. You’ll think I’ve seen things in the heat of battle. But I swear on the gods, they are not men. They are something else. Something... broken.

And yet, they are not invincible. I saw one of them falter. Whether it was because of the monk, or something deeper within them, I cannot say.

If they can break, then maybe—just maybe—we can make them fall.

### **Ruination Chamber: Heralds of the Fractured Aether**  
Among the shadowed alleys and crumbling ruins of Mordheim, tales have begun to spread of armored giants striding through the Wyrdstone-strewn streets. These enigmatic warriors call themselves *Reclusians*. To some, they are divine emissaries sent by Sigmar himself, celestial knights plucked from the heavens to purge the corruption of Chaos from this cursed city. To others, they are deluded zealots, twisted souls clad in scavenged armor, their minds broken by the impossible horrors that Mordheim has to offer.  

Their leader, known only as the **Lord-Vigilant**, preaches of a shattered gateway between realms—a rent in the "Aetheric Veil" through which they descended. Their arrival was heralded, they claim, by visions of Sigmar’s lightning-scorched throne and whispers of divine purpose. Yet no two warriors seem to remember the same journey, and their fragmented recollections only deepen the mystery surrounding their origins.

Though sometimes their "divine lightning" fizzles like alchemical tricks, and more than one blacksmith swears their "Sigmarite plate" looks suspiciously like repurposed Empire steel.

The warband’s behavior walks a razor’s edge between solemnity and absurdity, their zeal occasionally veering into the bizarre. Some examples include:  
- The Reclusians once declared an abandoned cabbage cart to be "a sigil of Sigmar's will" and led the warband in a day-long ritual to "purify" it.  
- Memorians sometimes forget their "divine purpose" and wander off mid-battle, leaving their companion to shout incoherent prayers until they reappear.  
- When some poor soul somehow asked them how they arrived in Mordheim, one warrior replied cryptically, "I was pulled through the sky on a chariot of golden lightning," while another simply muttered, "I tripped."

Despite their peculiarities, the Ruination Chamber fight with a ferocity that cannot be denied. Whether they are divine emissaries, lunatics, or something else entirely, one thing is certain: they are a force to be reckoned with, and Mordheim trembles beneath their storm-forged boots.

---

### **The Memorians: Echoes or Madness?**  
The Reclusians do not walk alone. Shadowing them are the Memorians, hooded figures who seem eerily devoted to their paired warriors. These Memorians speak in riddles, their mutterings invoking fragments of an otherworldly tongue. They claim to act as "Anchors," ensuring the warriors retain their divine clarity amidst the Wyrdstone’s maddening influence.  

However, there are darker rumors among those who have survived encounters with these warriors. Some insist the Memorians are the true masters of the warband, manipulating their so-called champions for some unknowable purpose. Others suggest they are hallucinations, figments of the reclussians’s cracked minds, or worse—manifestations of the Wyrdstone’s influence taking root.
